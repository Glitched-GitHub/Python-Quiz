**Project Challenges and Solutions**

- Challenge:

  The main challenge i faced was with converting and printing the scores stored within the dictionary.

- Solution:

  To solve this, I decided on storing certain scores as integer's and printing them within a string to get my desired look, while others were stored as string's and altered when scores had been finalised depending on which it was. This allowed me to find multiple methods to do the same thing depending on circumstances.
